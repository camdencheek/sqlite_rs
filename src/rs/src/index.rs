/// Each SQL index is represented in memory by an
/// instance of the following structure.
///
/// The columns of the table that are to be indexed are described
/// by the aiColumn[] field of this structure.  For example, suppose
/// we have the following table and index:
///
///     CREATE TABLE Ex1(c1 int, c2 int, c3 text);
///     CREATE INDEX Ex2 ON Ex1(c3,c1);
///
/// In the Table structure describing Ex1, nCol==3 because there are
/// three columns in the table.  In the Index structure describing
/// Ex2, nColumn==2 since 2 of the 3 columns of Ex1 are indexed.
/// The value of aiColumn is {2, 0}.  aiColumn[0]==2 because the
/// first column to be indexed (c3) has an index of 2 in Ex1.aCol[].
/// The second column to be indexed (c1) has an index of 0 in
/// Ex1.aCol[], hence Ex2.aiColumn[1]==0.
///
/// The Index.onError field determines whether or not the indexed columns
/// must be unique and what to do if they are not.  When Index.onError=OE_None,
/// it means this is not a unique index.  Otherwise it is a unique index
/// and the value of Index.onError indicates which conflict resolution
/// algorithm to employ when an attempt is made to insert a non-unique
/// element.
///
/// The colNotIdxed bitmask is used in combination with SrcItem.colUsed
/// for a fast test to see if an index can serve as a covering index.
/// colNotIdxed has a 1 bit for every column of the original table that
/// is *not* available in the index.  Thus the expression
/// "colUsed & colNotIdxed" will be non-zero if the index is not a
/// covering index.  The most significant bit of of colNotIdxed will always
/// be true (note-20221022-a).  If a column beyond the 63rd column of the
/// table is used, the "colUsed & colNotIdxed" test will always be non-zero
/// and we have to assume either that the index is not covering, or use
/// an alternative (slower) algorithm to determine whether or not
/// the index is covering.
///
/// While parsing a CREATE TABLE or CREATE INDEX statement in order to
/// generate VDBE code (as opposed to parsing one read from an sqlite_schema
/// table as part of parsing an existing database schema), transient instances
/// of this structure may be created. In this case the Index.tnum variable is
/// used to store the address of a VDBE instruction, not a database page
/// number (it cannot - the database page is not allocated until the VDBE
/// program is executed). See convertToWithoutRowidTable() for details.
