/*
** CAPI3REF: Memory Allocation Subsystem
**
** The SQLite core uses these three routines for all of its own
** internal memory allocation needs. "Core" in the previous sentence
** does not include operating-system specific [VFS] implementation.  The
** Windows VFS uses native malloc() and free() for some operations.
**
** ^The sqlite3_malloc() routine returns a pointer to a block
** of memory at least N bytes in length, where N is the parameter.
** ^If sqlite3_malloc() is unable to obtain sufficient free
** memory, it returns a NULL pointer.  ^If the parameter N to
** sqlite3_malloc() is zero or negative then sqlite3_malloc() returns
** a NULL pointer.
**
** ^The sqlite3_malloc64(N) routine works just like
** sqlite3_malloc(N) except that N is an unsigned 64-bit integer instead
** of a signed 32-bit integer.
**
** ^Calling sqlite3_free() with a pointer previously returned
** by sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_realloc() releases that memory so
** that it might be reused.  ^The sqlite3_free() routine is
** a no-op if is called with a NULL pointer.  Passing a NULL pointer
** to sqlite3_free() is harmless.  After being freed, memory
** should neither be read nor written.  Even reading previously freed
** memory might result in a segmentation fault or other severe error.
** Memory corruption, a segmentation fault, or other severe error
** might result if sqlite3_free() is called with a non-NULL pointer that
** was not obtained from sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_realloc().
**
** ^The sqlite3_realloc(X,N) interface attempts to resize a
** prior memory allocation X to be at least N bytes.
** ^If the X parameter to sqlite3_realloc(X,N)
** is a NULL pointer then its behavior is identical to calling
** sqlite3_malloc(N).
** ^If the N parameter to sqlite3_realloc(X,N) is zero or
** negative then the behavior is exactly the same as calling
** sqlite3_free(X).
** ^sqlite3_realloc(X,N) returns a pointer to a memory allocation
** of at least N bytes in size or NULL if insufficient memory is available.
** ^If M is the size of the prior allocation, then min(N,M) bytes
** of the prior allocation are copied into the beginning of buffer returned
** by sqlite3_realloc(X,N) and the prior allocation is freed.
** ^If sqlite3_realloc(X,N) returns NULL and N is positive, then the
** prior allocation is not freed.
**
** ^The sqlite3_realloc64(X,N) interfaces works the same as
** sqlite3_realloc(X,N) except that N is a 64-bit unsigned integer instead
** of a 32-bit signed integer.
**
** ^If X is a memory allocation previously obtained from sqlite3_malloc(),
** sqlite3_malloc64(), sqlite3_realloc(), or sqlite3_realloc64(), then
** sqlite3_msize(X) returns the size of that memory allocation in bytes.
** ^The value returned by sqlite3_msize(X) might be larger than the number
** of bytes requested when X was allocated.  ^If X is a NULL pointer then
** sqlite3_msize(X) returns zero.  If X points to something that is not
** the beginning of memory allocation, or if it points to a formerly
** valid memory allocation that has now been freed, then the behavior
** of sqlite3_msize(X) is undefined and possibly harmful.
**
** ^The memory returned by sqlite3_malloc(), sqlite3_realloc(),
** sqlite3_malloc64(), and sqlite3_realloc64()
** is always aligned to at least an 8 byte boundary, or to a
** 4 byte boundary if the [SQLITE_4_BYTE_ALIGNED_MALLOC] compile-time
** option is used.
**
** The pointer arguments to [sqlite3_free()] and [sqlite3_realloc()]
** must be either NULL or else pointers obtained from a prior
** invocation of [sqlite3_malloc()] or [sqlite3_realloc()] that have
** not yet been released.
**
** The application must not read or write any part of
** a block of memory after it has been released using
** [sqlite3_free()] or [sqlite3_realloc()].
