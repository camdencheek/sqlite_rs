/// Each node of an expression in the parse tree is an instance
/// of this structure.
///
/// Expr.op is the opcode. The integer parser token codes are reused
/// as opcodes here. For example, the parser defines TK_GE to be an integer
/// code representing the ">=" operator. This same integer code is reused
/// to represent the greater-than-or-equal-to operator in the expression
/// tree.
///
/// If the expression is an SQL literal (TK_INTEGER, TK_FLOAT, TK_BLOB,
/// or TK_STRING), then Expr.u.zToken contains the text of the SQL literal. If
/// the expression is a variable (TK_VARIABLE), then Expr.u.zToken contains the
/// variable name. Finally, if the expression is an SQL function (TK_FUNCTION),
/// then Expr.u.zToken contains the name of the function.
///
/// Expr.pRight and Expr.pLeft are the left and right subexpressions of a
/// binary operator. Either or both may be NULL.
///
/// Expr.x.pList is a list of arguments if the expression is an SQL function,
/// a CASE expression or an IN expression of the form "<lhs> IN (<y>, <z>...)".
/// Expr.x.pSelect is used if the expression is a sub-select or an expression of
/// the form "<lhs> IN (SELECT ...)". If the EP_xIsSelect bit is set in the
/// Expr.flags mask, then Expr.x.pSelect is valid. Otherwise, Expr.x.pList is
/// valid.
///
/// An expression of the form ID or ID.ID refers to a column in a table.
/// For such expressions, Expr.op is set to TK_COLUMN and Expr.iTable is
/// the integer cursor number of a VDBE cursor pointing to that table and
/// Expr.iColumn is the column number for the specific column.  If the
/// expression is used as a result in an aggregate SELECT, then the
/// value is also stored in the Expr.iAgg column in the aggregate so that
/// it can be accessed after all aggregates are computed.
///
/// If the expression is an unbound variable marker (a question mark
/// character '?' in the original SQL) then the Expr.iTable holds the index
/// number for that variable.
///
/// If the expression is a subquery then Expr.iColumn holds an integer
/// register number containing the result of the subquery.  If the
/// subquery gives a constant result, then iTable is -1.  If the subquery
/// gives a different answer at different times during statement processing
/// then iTable is the address of a subroutine that computes the subquery.
///
/// If the Expr is of type OP_Column, and the table it is selecting from
/// is a disk table or the "old.*" pseudo-table, then pTab points to the
/// corresponding table definition.
///
/// ALLOCATION NOTES:
///
/// Expr objects can use a lot of memory space in database schema.  To
/// help reduce memory requirements, sometimes an Expr object will be
/// truncated.  And to reduce the number of memory allocations, sometimes
/// two or more Expr objects will be stored in a single memory allocation,
/// together with Expr.u.zToken strings.
///
/// If the EP_Reduced and EP_TokenOnly flags are set when
/// an Expr object is truncated.  When EP_Reduced is set, then all
/// the child Expr objects in the Expr.pLeft and Expr.pRight subtrees
/// are contained within the same memory allocation.  Note, however, that
/// the subtrees in Expr.x.pList or Expr.x.pSelect are always separately
/// allocated, regardless of whether or not EP_Reduced is set.
