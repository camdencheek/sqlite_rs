** An instance of the following structure contains all information

**
** See the header comment on the computeLimitRegisters() routine for a
** detailed description of the meaning of the iLimit and iOffset fields.
**
** addrOpenEphm[] entries contain the address of OP_OpenEphemeral opcodes.
** These addresses must be stored so that we can go back and fill in
** the P4_KEYINFO and P2 parameters later.  Neither the KeyInfo nor
** the number of columns in P2 can be computed at the same time
** as the OP_OpenEphm instruction is coded because not
** enough information about the compound query is known at that point.
** The KeyInfo for addrOpenTran[0] and [1] contains collating sequences
** for the result set.  The KeyInfo for addrOpenEphm[2] contains collating
** sequences for the ORDER BY clause.
